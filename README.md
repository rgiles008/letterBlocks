## Letter Blocks ##
Many household decorations have a series of wooden blocks with letters on each side. 
They can be arranged in many ways, to spell various words, representing various seasons or holidays. 
Typically, a set might have the letters to spell out a few words, such as Joy, Boo, Home, etc. with blank spaces being filled with pictures instead of letters. 
We want to know all possible unique single words that you can create by rearranging the blocks.

The goal is like the game Boggle, to arrange as many words as possible against a dictionary to make as many possible words as you can.
Given the example: 
[['H','L','S','J','U','B'],
['O','O','N','O','S','O'],
['M','V','O','Y','A','O'],
['E','E','W','' ,'' ,'' ]]

For example, the string `nob` is valid, but `woo` is not, because that leaves a block unused.
